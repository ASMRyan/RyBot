### General Info

This project is a Python-based Discord bot designed for highly targeted custom use cases for Queercraft. Its original purpose is to be able to delete all messages in a specific channel from users who are no longer members of the Discord server. It is not intended for any other purposes or communities.

Current Functions:
* `omnomnom`: **O**ld **M**essages **N**ow **O**bsolete **M**eaning **N**o **O**vert **M**ass - Deletes all messages in the channel sent by users no longer in the Discord server. This currently only works in Queercraft's #introductions channel.
* `leave`: Kick the bot to the curb.
